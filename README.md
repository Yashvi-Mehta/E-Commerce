# Welcome to the Deloitte Web engineering exercise

A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the web browser by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages. 

The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.

Web browser JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as AngularJS, Ember.js, ExtJS, Knockout.js, Meteor.js, React and Vue.js have adopted SPA principles.

The objective of this problem is to build a SPA without using any JavaScript frameworks

We perform these exercises to get a feel for how you approach challenging problems.

## Introduction

You will be building a web application using SASS, Javascript, and NodeJS

The data required for this task can be hardcoded on a local api server in JSON format. You will be expected to fetch
(or AJAX) the data into your web application and manipulate/filter the results to display.

The creative and business analyst teams have provide you with some supporting designs which can be found in the `designs`
folder.

Above all, we're not expecting a completed masterpiece. We're looking for your attention to detail, semantic goodness, 
and to see how you tackle different problems.

Note: 
Key aspects that will be evaluated will be best practices followed for
- Version Control using git, eg. Branching, naming conventions, PR descriptions etc
- Styling eg. use of preprocessors, mixins, variables.
- HTML eg. semantic tags, hierarchy of tags
- JS eg. use of ES6 syntax, file/folder structure, separation of concerns etc.
- SPA approach and reasoning for approach

Good luck!

## Prerequisites

- You have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) v8 with npm installed
- You are familiar with entering simple [terminal commands](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line)
- You are familiar with [Git source control](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)
- You will require an internet connection to install npm packages
- An editor of your choice (e.g. [Atom](https://atom.io/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), or your own editor/IDE)


## Instructions

**1. Assumptions**

Please list any assumptions in the `ASSUMPTIONS.md` file that you have made in order to solve any problems.

**2. Read the Getting Started guide below**

**3. Read the Requirements and start building your application**

**4. Submit your solution for review.**

Submission details are down below.

## Getting started

We have provided you with a hi-fidelity desktop design file for the app, located at `/designs`.

You should make your solution match these designs as closely as possible.

Unfortunately, the creative team have not provided any mobile designs and look to your expertise in making it responsive.

## Requirements

- In your approach, consider this project exactly as you would a real-world project.
- Your solution must be a responsive web application.
- Please use SCSS if you would like to use a precompiler for CSS.
- Your application must fetch/ajax all data. By default, ALL furniture should be listed.
- If at anytime, there is no listing data to display, your application should tell users there are no results.
- If your application is ever busy, this should be reflected in the interface (eg a loader in the center of the screen).
- Your solution must work in IE11, latest Chrome/Firefox/Safari (including touch devices).
- Your solution must be valid, semantic HTML and Accessible to the WCAG 2.0 Level AA standard (good to have)
- Consistent code formatting is good. We recommend using a linter for your CSS and JS ex. ESLint

## Submitting your solution

1. Ensure you have added your assumptions to the `ASSUMPTIONS.md`
2. Delete the `node_modules` folder from the root of your project and the server folder.
3. Add instructions to this file ie. README.md on how to run the project.
4. ZIP up the project root folder and include your name in the filename. eg (JohnSmith-fed-exercise.zip)
5. Either email the zip back as an attachment OR upload onto dropbox/google drive and send us the download link.
